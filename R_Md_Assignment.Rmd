# TREES DATA STRUCTURE

Trees represent nodes connected by edges eg. binary trees, AVL trees etc.
Example:

**important terms**


+ Path


+ Root


+ Parent


+ Edges


+ Nodes


+ Subtree


+ Branches


+ Levels



## Binary trees


This is a tree data structure which each node a maximum of two children (left child and right child).

## Types of binary trees.


### _complete binary tree_
Every level except possibly the last is completely filled and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.


### _full/proper/plane binary tree_
Its a tree in which every node have either 0 or 2 children.


# Basic Operations.
* insert


* search


* traversal


# __TREE TRAVERSAL__

This is the process of visiting all nodes in a tree and print all the values starting from the root.

## Methods of tree traversal

### 1. in order traversal.


The left child/subtree is visited first, then the root/parent and later the right child/subtree (L rt R).


### 2. pre order traversal.
The root/parent node is visited first then the left child/subtree and finally the right child/subtree (rt L R).


### 3. post order traversal.
The left child/subtree is visited first followed by the right child/subtree and lastly the root/parent(L R rt).
